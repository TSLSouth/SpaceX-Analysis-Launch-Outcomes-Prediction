# Project: SpaceX Analysis and Launching Outcomes Prediction

<br>

## **Abstract:**

This is part of the final project presented to IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. 
In this repo we go through out the CRISP-DM/DS framework (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining/Data Science).
As we simulate to be a SpaceX competitor we need to understand the costs and outcomes of a launching. The hypothesis was:
if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. And with a deep data analysis we can understand
the most profitable and successful rockets of SpaceX and others insightful details.

## **Orientations about the files:**

Start seeing the .PDF file. It's a complete presentation about the project in slides.
The notebook is huge one because everything is in there. So, make sure to use a IDE with collapsable capabities to go through everything.
